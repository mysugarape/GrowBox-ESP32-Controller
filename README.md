# GrowBox-ESP32-Controller
a ESP32 based Controler for a GrowBox or any other Greenhouse

That's my project for a Greenhouse or GrowBox Controller, which you can easily build yourself. Many commercial controllers do the same thing and cost a lot of money, so let's create a DIY one. 

I am not a pro at esp32 programming, but I know how to use AI technology for the parts I don't know. So most of the script was provided from chatGPT and only a small portion and the debugging was done by me. So far it ist working but is roughly in BETA Stage. If any progress is made from the code side, I will update this git.

Bill of Materials (BOM)
